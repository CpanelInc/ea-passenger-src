# What this package is for

This package is intended for things that need passenger source code like, `ea-apache24-mod-passenger` and `ea-nginx`.

This passenger will use the system ruby. As always an application can use whatever ruby it wants to (or even non-ruby), regardless of what ruby passenger is using.

For more details see the [Design Doc](DESIGN.md).

# How to use this package

3. Use `%{buildroot}/_passenger_source_code` to configure and build the thing.
